FEEDBACK:

Good implementation of garbage collection of your LazySearchTree class.
  You are very close.
  Make sure to increase the implementation coverage of your test cases.


-2 After garbage collection hard size and soft size must match.	
   See sample output 1 and 2 below.


-0 Missing documentation for your class Traverser, class Item, etc. in Javadocs.
   Did you forget to verify whether your index.html file in "doc" folder generated correctly? 
   Next time minus for this.
   

other comments:
In your README you state that "inventory_short_debugging.txt" is for "with better human reading option".
    Please clarify how this test file is easier for you to read.

sample output 1:
...
State of inventory before cleanup:
"hard" number of unique items (i.e. mSizeHard) = 1
"soft" number of unique items (i.e. mSize) = 1

Testing traversing "hard" inventory:
bread:0  butter:1  

Testing traversing "soft" inventory:
butter:1  



Final state of inventory after cleanup:
"hard" number of unique items (i.e. mSizeHard) = 0
"soft" number of unique items (i.e. mSize) = 1

Testing traversing "hard" inventory:
bread:0  butter:1  

Testing traversing "soft" inventory:
butter:1  



sample output 2:
...

calling garbage collection...  <----------------

inventory after garbage collection:
"hard" number of unique items (i.e. mSizeHard) = 14
"soft" number of unique items (i.e. mSize) = 12

Testing traversing "hard" inventory:
apples:1  avocado:1  basil:1  beans:2  bread:1  cake:1  cereal:1  chicken:1  eggplant:2  fish:1  juice:2  milk:2  soup:2  tomato:4
