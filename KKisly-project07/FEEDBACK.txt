FEEDBACK:

-10% late submission.


Good testing of the FIND_SONG_BY_ID.


Good overloading of hashCode() and compareTo() methods in wrapper 
   classes SongsCompInt and SongsInGenre.
   
   
-1 Compilation error in class FHhashQPwFind:
The method size() is undefined for the type SongEntry
	Why are you returning the size of the SongEntry class?
	Instead this should be returning the size of the "allSongs" ArrayList in class SongsCompGenre:
	public ArrayList<SongEntry> getData() 
	{	return allSongs;  }


-1 Incomplete implementation of the number of songs in each genre.
     The goal of SongsCompGenre class  ArrayList<String> songNames class field
	is to keep track the number of songs in each genre.
	To do that you simply need to add a song to an existing genre.
	
	The output in project description "The partial output of example using the full..." shows:	
"Number of store songs in each genre:
classic pop and rock 	  23895 
                punk 	   3200 
                etc.        ...
Finding genre: pop
..."

	Make sure to always check the instructor output and
	if something does not make sense ask a question either in office hours or by posting in discussion forum.
	

-0.5 The documentation for your TableGenerator class, GHahsQPwFind, etc methods describe methods 
   with one or two words instead of complete sentences. 
   zFor example, what does "table" mean? The description
   seems misleading. For future provide a more clear description.
   
   Take a look at the Javadocs provided by Oracle for our favorite String class: 
   https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html
   
   How are Javadocs files useful if they do not relay to the user the purpose of your classes and methods? 
   
   Next time minus for each class.

-Bita.
