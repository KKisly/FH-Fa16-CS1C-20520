FEEDBACK:

-10% late submission.

Overall, well done in sticking to it this quarter.
	In your future academic endeavors strive to start your projects (whatever they may be)
	on day one. That way you are not rushed in hacking a last minute solution together.
	Instead giving yourself time will give you time to explore different solutions and 
	perhaps be creative and discovering your own!
	
	
-1 Missing annotations on graph as required by project description:
"annotate the graph with your findings (such as optimal recursion limit);"
   What is the optimal recursion limit (range) you refer to in your README file?


-1 Several missing requirements for each graph which makes it difficult to read.
   What are the axis labels?
   Clarify what does the legend label "Series 1" refers to. What array size is each one graphing?
   
-Bita.
